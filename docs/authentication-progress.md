# Authentication System Progress

## Overview

We have successfully implemented the core authentication system for Wizz Stage One, including:

1. Passphrase-based access system
2. User registration
3. User login
4. Mock database for development

## Implementation Details

### Backend

- **Passphrase Verification**: Users can verify their passphrase before registering
- **User Registration**: New users can create an account with email and password
- **User Login**: Existing users can log in with their credentials
- **Mock Database**: In-memory storage for development and testing
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /auth/verify-passphrase` - Verify a passphrase
  - `POST /auth/register` - Register a new user
  - `POST /auth/login` - Log in an existing user
  - `GET /auth/passphrases` - Get all passphrases (for testing)
  - `POST /auth/add-passphrase` - Add a passphrase (for testing)

### Frontend

- **Passphrase Verification Component**: UI for entering and verifying passphrases
- **Registration Component**: UI for creating a new account
- **Authentication Flow**: Integrated components to handle the complete authentication flow

## Testing

All authentication endpoints have been tested and are working correctly:

1. Passphrase verification
2. User registration
3. User login

## Next Steps

1. Implement session management or JWT tokens for authenticated users
2. Add validation and error handling for all endpoints
3. Implement proper password hashing (currently using plain text in mock database)
4. Add database migrations for production deployment
5. Implement unit tests for authentication routes
6. Add rate limiting and security measures

## Running the Authentication System

To test the authentication system:

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm start
   ```

2. Add a test passphrase:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"passphrase":"wizz-test-123"}' http://localhost:3001/auth/add-passphrase
   ```

3. Verify the passphrase:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"passphrase":"wizz-test-123"}' http://localhost:3001/auth/verify-passphrase
   ```

4. Register a user:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}' http://localhost:3001/auth/register
   ```

5. Log in as the user:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}' http://localhost:3001/auth/login
   ```

The frontend components are also available at http://localhost:3000 to test the complete authentication flow.
