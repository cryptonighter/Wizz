# Compass Creation Wizard Progress

## Overview

We have successfully implemented the Compass Creation Wizard for Wizz Stage One, including:

1. Compass data model and storage
2. Superpower Wizard with explore/commit functionality
3. Multi-step Compass Creation Wizard UI
4. Backend API endpoints for compass management

## Implementation Details

### Backend

- **Compass Model**: Handles creation, retrieval, and updating of user compasses
- **Compass Routes**: API endpoints for compass management:
  - `POST /compass` - Create or update a compass
  - `GET /compass` - Get the current user's compass
  - `PUT /compass` - Update the current user's compass
- **Mock Database**: In-memory storage for development and testing

### Frontend

- **SuperpowerWizard Component**: Implements the explore/commit flow for discovering the user's superpower
  - Exploration Phase: Hero Story, Energy Lens, and Keyword Cloud inputs
  - Commit Phase: Review and refine the suggested superpower statement
- **CompassCreationWizard Component**: Orchestrates the entire compass creation process
  - Multi-step wizard with progress indicator
  - Steps: Intro, Superpower, Hues, Values, Skills, Travel Style, Complete
- **UI Components**: Styled components with responsive design

## Features

### Superpower Wizard

The signature feature of the Compass Creation Wizard:

1. **Exploration Phase**:
   - Hero Story: Users describe a time they felt like a hero at work
   - Energy Lens: Users identify activities that energize them
   - Keyword Cloud: Users select resonant keywords from a predefined list

2. **Commit Phase**:
   - AI-generated suggestion based on exploration inputs
   - Ability to edit and refine the superpower statement
   - Confirmation of the final superpower

### Compass Creation Wizard

A guided, multi-step process to define the user's professional DNA:

1. **Intro Step**: Explanation of the compass and what to expect
2. **Superpower Step**: Superpower Wizard implementation
3. **Hues Step**: Define key characteristics of work style
4. **Values Step**: Identify core guiding principles
5. **Skills Step**: List strongest professional skills
6. **Travel Style Step**: Describe approach to new challenges
7. **Complete Step**: Confirmation and transition to dashboard

## Testing

All compass endpoints have been tested and are working correctly:

1. Creating a compass
2. Getting a compass
3. Updating a compass

## Next Steps

1. Implement proper user authentication and session management
2. Add validation and error handling for all endpoints
3. Implement database migrations for production deployment
4. Add unit tests for frontend components
5. Implement proper state management (e.g., Redux or Context API)
6. Add animations and transitions for better UX
7. Implement data persistence with a real database

## Running the Compass Creation Wizard

To test the Compass Creation Wizard:

1. Start both backend and frontend servers:
   ```bash
   # In one terminal
   cd backend && npm start
   
   # In another terminal
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

2. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

3. Go through the authentication flow (passphrase verification and registration)

4. Proceed to the Compass Creation Wizard

5. Test the backend API directly:
   ```bash
   # Create a compass
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"superpower":{"exploration":{"heroStory":"I helped my team meet a tight deadline","energyLens":"Solving complex problems","keywordCloud":["Simplify","Organize"]},"statement":"Turning chaos into clarity"},"hues":["Collaborative","Detail-oriented"],"values":["Integrity","Growth"],"skills":["JavaScript","React"],"travelStyle":"Methodical explorer"}' http://localhost:3001/compass
   
   # Get a compass
   curl http://localhost:3001/compass
   
   # Update a compass
   curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"superpower":{"exploration":{"heroStory":"I helped my team meet a tight deadline","energyLens":"Solving complex problems","keywordCloud":["Simplify","Organize"]},"statement":"Turning chaos into clarity"},"hues":["Collaborative","Detail-oriented"],"values":["Integrity","Growth","Innovation"],"skills":["JavaScript","React","Node.js"],"travelStyle":"Methodical explorer"}' http://localhost:3001/compass
   ```

The frontend components provide a complete user experience for creating and managing the compass.
