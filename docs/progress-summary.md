# Wizz Stage One Development Progress Summary

## Current Status

We have successfully completed the foundational setup for Stage One of Wizz: The Personal Alignment Engine.

### Project Structure
- Restructured the project into a monorepo with separate backend and frontend directories
- Created a clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend
- Established a modular architecture that can evolve through all three stages

### Technology Stack Implementation
- **Backend**: Node.js with Fastify framework
- **Frontend**: React with Vite build tool
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with defined schema
- **Authentication**: Passphrase-based access system (planned)

### Core Components
1. **Backend Server**
   - REST API foundation with Fastify
   - CORS configuration for frontend integration
   - Modular structure for future expansion

2. **Frontend Application**
   - React application with Vite development server
   - Proxy configuration for backend API calls
   - Basic UI with integration to backend

3. **Database Schema**
   - Defined tables for users, passphrases, compasses, quests, and check-ins
   - Prepared for future AI features with vector storage

### Testing
- Implemented unit tests for backend API
- Set up Jest testing framework
- Verified server functionality with automated tests

### Development Environment
- Concurrent development of frontend and backend
- Hot reloading for both frontend and backend
- Proper error handling and logging

## Next Steps

1. Implement user authentication and passphrase-based access
2. Develop the Compass Creation Wizard with Superpower Discovery flow
3. Create Quest management system with Check-in prompts
4. Build the Dashboard as the user's home base
5. Implement data persistence with PostgreSQL
6. Add more comprehensive testing including integration tests

## Running the Application

To start both the backend and frontend in development mode:

```bash
# In one terminal, start the backend:
cd backend && npm run dev

# In another terminal, start the frontend:
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

The backend will be available at http://localhost:3001
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000
